## Game Objective and Rules
- The Hand Cricket game is a simple yet fun game played between two players - a batsman and a bowler.
- The batsman and bowler simultaneously show a number between 1 and 6 using their fingers.
- If the numbers match, the batsman is out.
- If the numbers do not match, the batsman scores the number they showed.
- The objective is to outscore your opponent by predicting their moves and trying to stay in as the batsman for as long as possible.

## Technology Stack Used
- **HTML**: For the game's user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the game's interface.
- **JavaScript**: To handle the game logic and user interactions.
- **Python**: To implement the algorithm for playing the game.

## Setup and Deployment Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**: git clone https://github.com/sreerampaladugu10/Handcricket.git


2. **Open the Game**:
- Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to play the game.

3. **Play the Game**:
- Follow the on-screen instructions to play against the computer.

## Credits
- The game was developed by [Your Name] and is open source.
- Special thanks to [Name of any libraries or assets you used] for their contributions to this project.

## Reflection
In the process of designing and developing the Hand Cricket game, we encountered several challenges and learned valuable lessons:

- **Challenges Faced**:
- Developing a Hand Cricket game can be a fun and rewarding project, but it can also come with its share of challenges. Here are some common challenges we have faced while developing a Hand Cricket game:
- Game Logic: It can be difficult to make sure that the logic and rules of the game are applied correctly. There are certain rules for Hand Cricket, and following them is crucial to having a real gaming experience.

- [Mention any hurdles in implementing the Python algorithm]

- **What Worked**:
- Discussing the successful aspects of your design, development, and teamwork in the Hand Cricket game project
- User-Friendly Interface: One of the successful aspects of the project was the creation of a user-friendly and intuitive interface. The interface was designed to be visually appealing and easy to understand, making it accessible to players of all ages and skill levels.
- Effective Game Logic: The game's core logic, which involves predicting and countering the opponent's moves, was well-implemented. It created an engaging and competitive gaming experience, keeping players involved and challenged.
- Version Control: Utilizing Git and a version control system helped keep the project organized and allowed for easy tracking of changes. This was crucial in managing the codebase and collaborating with team members.
- Testing and bug fixing: Strict testing protocols and efficient bug-repair techniques were in place. In addition to improving the overall user experience, this guaranteed the game was reliable and devoid of serious bugs.
- [Highlight any effective coding techniques]
- Algorithm Development: The development of the Python algorithm for simulating the opponent's moves was a significant achievement. It added an element of unpredictability to the game and made the single-player mode enjoyable and challenging.

- **What Didn't Work**:
- [Share any aspects of the project that didn't go as planned]
- [Discuss any code or design decisions that had to be revised]

- **Lessons Learned**:
- [Reflect on what you learned during the project]
- [Explain how these lessons can be applied to future projects]

The Hand Cricket game project was an enjoyable experience, and we look forward to further improvements and collaborations in the future. We hope you have as much fun playing the game as we did creating it!
